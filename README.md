- Hello, my name is Zachariah Lamb. I recently made the switch from a wildlife sanctuary career to Computer Science!
- I am currently a Sophomore at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in A.I. and Machine Learning.

- Projects I am currently interested in and/or working on are: 
- 1. A Tire Pressure Monitoring System for my 94' Wrangler with a live in-cab display.
- 2. A point-based map and destination application designed to efficiently decide clients for professional petsitters based on relevant location and client relation.
- 3. A data collection and representation database using wolf location/wolf kill sites to present to wolf reintroduction opposition in C.O.. 

- I can be contacted at zlamb_94@hotmail.com or zplamb@colostate.edu
